By now it's pretty obvious that I fell off of the NoVIMber wagon. I haven't made any posts recently because I've been discouraged that NoVIMber was a bit of a flop. It wasn't a total failure though! I learned several awesome things about Vim! Reflecting on NoVIMber 2014, there was one major reason that caused me to quit halfway through: **Scope creep**

My original intention was to write short posts about a single command (or series of commands) each day. This would be a manageable time investment and relatively easy to commit to memory. Instead the posts turned rather monolithic and became difficult to remember in a single day. It's silly to make a blog post about such things when you're not actively adding it to your repertoire. I think these were valuable lessons for **all** of my future projects. There's a fine line between healthy ambition and overambition.

So what am I going to do now? I've decided that it's time to get back on track with my development outside of work. I've had a subscription to [Safari Books](https://safaribooksonline.com) for a long time but I use it pretty sparingly - which is a shame since the service is great. When I first subscribed, I'd try to dedicate an hour each day (after work) to reading. It actually worked out really well for a while. Unfortunately, I let life get in the way and fell off of the wagon. I'm going to try something similar again. This time I'm going to guarantee at least 30 minutes per day with 60 minutes being the goal. Once I finish a book (or give up on a book if it's truly awful), I plan on summarizing my thoughts in a blog post here - a kind of informal review.

That brings me to the first book on my list: [How Linux Works: What Every Superuser Should Know (2nd Edition)](http://www.amazon.com/How-Linux-Works-Superuser-Should/dp/1593275676) by [Brian Ward](http://www.amazon.com/Brian-Ward/e/B0045A0OHU). I started this book toward the end of November, shortly after its release, and I've enjoyed it thus far. I have a feeling a good portion of it will be review however a quick look at the table of contents leads me to believe that there will be some pretty cool information later. I'll post a full summary/review once I've completed the book.

That's all for now! Happy Holidays!

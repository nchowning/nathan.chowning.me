I had mentioned in my first or second post that this site was being hosted on a temporary server due to my current web server not supporting Django 1.7 (centos 6 with python 2.6). I've finally started rebuilding my primary web server. The first site to move over was this one! If you happen to notice any issues, please contact me via email (nathan at chowning.me) or twitter ([@nbchowning](http://twitter.com/nbchowning/)).

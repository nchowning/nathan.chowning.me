I recently added a new page to my website - video game bucket list (which I have since removed again). There are a lot of games that I've "been meaning" to play or "been meaning to finish" for years. The list is so long that it has gotten hard for me to keep track of. I've decided to keep a "video game bucket list" and actively try to whittle it down.

With August being [Metroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroid_(video_game))'s 30th anniversary, I figured I should play a Metroid game. I had initially wanted to start with [Metroid: Zero Mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroid:_Zero_Mission) - a remake of the original NES Metroid game - however I did not have a copy of it and couldn't easily track one down locally. That lead me to the fourth game in the Metroid Series - [Metroid Fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroid_Fusion).

The plot is quite intriguing. Samus, while exploring SR388 with a survey crew, unknowingly becomes infected with something called the "X parasite". It turns out that the Metroid of SR388 were the X's natural predators. Without Metroid, the X has run rampant. Using a vaccine made from the cells of the infant Metroid from Super Metroid, the Galactic Federation is able to conteract the damage caused by the "X parasite". Parts of Samus' infected suit were surgically removed & sent to the Biologic Space Laboratories station for research which lead to the X rampantly taking over the station. Samus is then sent to investigate.

I always have a hard time getting drawn into games at the beginning. They're usually too wordy with their narrative or overly boring. Metroid Fusion did a great job of giving me just enough story mixed in with lots of awesome action! Most Metroid games are known for their "alone" ambiance. Without going into spoilers, I'll say that Metroid Fusion does a good job of accomplishing that same feeling while also incorporating an almost horror/panic feeling. There were a few parts that absolutely got my heart racing!

Metroid series games - specifically the boss fights - can be difficult for some casual gamers. I feel like Metroid Fusion was just right. There were a few bosses that took me several tries but generally I felt like it was always a fair fight. The bosses that I found the most difficult/frustrating were:

### Security Robot B.O.X.
This fight took me a while because hitting the middle part while it was frantically running around was difficult. Naturally you have to fight this boss twice =\

### Gedo X
Gedo X is a giant spider that diagonally moves up and down the screen. If it catches you, it will slowly drag you up the screen while sucking the life out of you. Once it gets to the top, it slams you down to the ground doing significant damage. It took me a while to figure out how to keep it from picking me up. Pro-tip: use morph ball in the corners when it's close to the ground.

### Nightmare X
This boss took me several tries to beat. During parts of the fight, he will chase you around the room trying to slam into you doing large amounts of damage. I never quite got the hang of his movement in that part.

### Neo Ridley
Ridley was difficult for a different reason. He takes a MASSIVE number of super missiles to defeat. My maximum missle capacity before this fight was 115 and I had a little over half of that available to me (mid 60s). It wasn't enough! After getting his AI movement down & beating the crap out of him, I ran out of missiles! NOT GOOD! I ended up needing to spend about an hour farming missiles in a nearby room to defeat him. 115 was JUST enough. When the fight was over, I literally had 0 missiles left.

I managed to beat Neo Ridley while waiting at the optometrist (before they dilated my eyes haha). AS SOON as I beat him, they called me back into the exam room and I didn't have time to get to a save point! I turned the volume down & just jammed it in my pocket. The picture above was taken when I finally got the chance to save!

![Only 35%?!]({filename}/images/metroid_fusion_complete.png)

As you can see, I only managed to gather 35% of the hidden items. At the beginning, I didn't really do a lot of extra exploring & that probably cost me a lot of extra missile upgrades. Metroid Fusion was a lot of fun and I'd definitely play it again! Maybe I'll play again some day & explore more!

Last night I started playing [The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_A_Link_to_the_Past) - the GBA version. That'll be the next game knocked off of my bucket list!

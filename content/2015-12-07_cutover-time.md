I've mostly finished converting my old HTML posts to markdown. There might be a few errors here & there. I plan on proofreading them gradually & correcting any errors that I missed. There's one post (getting telegram working in bitlbee) that I haven't converted yet because it's going to be more of a manual process. I'll hopefully get to that tomorrow.

I've move DNS for nathan.chowning.me & nathanchowning.com to point here now. If you're seeing this, Hello!
